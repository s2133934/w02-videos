# Python Programming - Week 2 videos

Code for the Week 2 videos.
- `week02_lecture.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook used for the slides.
- `week02_demo.py` is the final version of the Python script from the code-along video.

You can click "Fork" at the top right of the page on GitHub to make a copy of this code to your own GitHub account, if you'd like to play around with it.
--> This code was written and sent out by C Desvages, Lecturer in Python programming at University of Edinburgh. My contribution was to complete the notebook as part of the course and as she describes above in this README, to play with it!
